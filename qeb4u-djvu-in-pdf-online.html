_Making the most out of MacOS Mojave_  Since friends and family have been asking me about setting up their new Macs, I figured I‚Äôd compile some of the stuff that I do/like/use for anybody wandering in from a Google search, or just from /r/all. I spend a lot of time using my Mac, so I hunt down lots of little things.  1. Browsing: The bulk of my peers spend their computer time browsing the web and consuming media.

Many of you have been messaging and asking for the sources I used to show my wife regarding date of Jerusalem‚Äôs destruction. Mainly because they were instrumental in waking her up. (https://old.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/9iix0u/telling_my_pimi_wife_about_607587_bce_update/) Your patience has been appreciated. It‚Äôs taken me awhile to piece together my many notes and links into a cohesive and easily read format. I‚Äôm sure there are more sources out there I am a mathematics student. It is not possible for me to buy every book that I need. I was looking for some easy ways to get print books. I searched on reddit and I found this answer(It was fairly up voted). amp#x200B; gtWhen i was a student, I downloaded all my books\ for free online (Library Genesis is your friend!), printed them on high-quality thick paper using an online printing service, had them all cut to the original size, then sent them to a bookbinder to give them all a custo.

Thought it would be useful to get an app recommendation thread going for those of us who still use BB10 devices as our daily drivers. I'll get this going, and try to stick with applications that fulfill day-to-day needs, while giving preference to native ones. Though Android apps will definitely not be excluded, I will only list those that work wonderfully with BB10 (E.g. being able to write to the sd card). These will all be quality apps. I'm on a Classic BTW. Maybe if we get enough input. Having used Pocket's article-archival-and-management tool -- sort of a bookmarks-on-steroids product -- for the past year or two, and with news that the company has just been acquired by Mozilla (it's been getting increasingly integrated into Firefox over the past year or so), I've realised one of my most fundamental complaints about it. The more I use Pocket, the worse it gets. As I've mentioned (a few too many times), I do a lot of research, much of it with articles and documents

I recently had to do a clean install on a laptop, and I used it as an opportunity to really assess which programs where necessary for my everyday use. The following is a list of every program I installed. I tried to give a description of what they do, and why I chose them. It was too long unfortunately, so I am using this as a skeleton post and will post the details I originally wrote to go with it in the comments. I'll try to add a short description length permitting.

A ~~brief~~ (who was I kidding?) note on research tools I've found useful, to at least some extent, in acquiring, assimilating, converting, and organising infromation. If you're looking for a total solution, you are apt to be disappoint. I certainly am. But these have been a start. Where I can, I obtain materials online. The Internet Archive (https://www.archive.org) has a fantastic, and legal, compendium of texts. Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) I know the Perseus Project and Textkit sites contain the works of several Greek authors online, but the texts seem to be integrated into the websites themselves, whereas I'm seeking something in a more reader-friendly format. Specifically I am interested in trying to read Aristotle and some of the early Greek Church Fathers in the original, but I'm curious where I should go in general to find Greek texts as pdf or djvu files instead of directly integrated into a website.
